## Why Opia?

I named Opia after a concept from "The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows." Opia refers to the intense feeling experienced during deep eye contact, a sensation that can feel both invasive and vulnerable.

I chose this name because it reflects my project's mission in two ways:
- **Delving Deep:** Just as eye contact fosters a deeper connection, Opia strives to delve into the potential of AI, exploring its capabilities for artistic creation and image analysis.
- **Pushing Boundaries:** The uncomfortable vulnerability of eye contact mirrors my desire to push the boundaries of technology and explore uncharted territories within AI.

While the name might have a deeper meaning for me, Opia is ultimately your gateway to a world of AI-powered creativity and image insights.

## Project Origin

Opia was developed as part of the GitHub Universe 2023 Cloud Skills Challenge. This challenge provided the perfect opportunity to combine my passion for AI and creativity, resulting in a unique application that showcases the power of Azure AI.
